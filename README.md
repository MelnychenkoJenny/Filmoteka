# COMMAND PROJECT FILMOTEKA

The main goal of the project was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing website where users can choose a movie for solitary viewing, a night with friends, or a cozy evening with a loved one. We wanted our site to be intuitive for every user, leaving no questions about how to use it. Users are provided with a list of top-recommended movies, with the ability to read the synopsis and choose a movie to their liking.
